**carrion-strap is a CSS library built for [carrion.chat]. come get some strap.**

carrion-strap is there to make writing profiles and chat more straightforward. It's a collection of styles that will work on all up-to-date browsers. It's not opinionated about what your page should look like; it just wants to help you get it made. This library is free; you can just use it.

⚠️ ***This library released on January 23rd. It's in beta. These docs are a work in progress.***

## [For profiles](./profile)

carrion-strap provides a range of light-weight **utility classes** to handle everyday styling: bold/italic, serif/sans-serif, and a bunch of other little things.

It also provides larger-scale **components** to provide features like a gallery with minimal work.

## [For chat](./chat)

carrion-strap provides **chat themeing** that will simplify configuring colors and text for chat. You just say what you want things to look like, and carrion-strap will handle styling the individual elements so that you, personally, don't have to know where everything goes (or even care if the layout changes a bit).

## Update plans

carrion-strap is currently in beta (v0). When we make updates, the CSS files that currently exist will be updated in-place, so you will just get updates and access to new stuff automatically.

When carrion-strap updates to v1, all v0 code will remain working exactly where it is — it just won't get updated anymore.

The following is planned already for v1:

- `v0/profile/main.css` → `v1/profile.css`
